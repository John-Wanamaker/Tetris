# Tetris

The Tetris game implementation provided here is a Java application that allows players to enjoy the classic Tetris experience. Developed by John Wanamaker in 2021, this Tetris game features a graphical user interface built with Java's Swing framework. The game consists of falling tetromino pieces that players can rotate and move horizontally to create complete rows in the game board. Once a row is filled, it is cleared, and the player earns points based on the number of rows cleared simultaneously. The game ends if the tetromino stack reaches the top row of the board, triggering a game over message. Players have the option to play again or exit the game. The controls are simple and intuitive, with arrow keys for movement, the spacebar for quick descent, and the up arrow for rotating the pieces. With colorful graphics and smooth gameplay, this Tetris implementation offers a nostalgic gaming experience for players of all ages.
